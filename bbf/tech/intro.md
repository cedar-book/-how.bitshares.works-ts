## Introduction

The BitShares Blockchain, as it exists today, was launched on 13th October 2015 with its community having found together already in 2013. It implements an **industrial-grade decentralized platform** built for **high-performance smart contracts** with focus on the financial technologies sector.

Furthermore, BitShares represents the first decentralized autonomous cooperation that lets holders of its core native token **BTS** decide on its future direction and governance aspects. For sake of clarity and to avoid confusion with other smart contracting platforms, the BitShares Blockchain implements its contracts in form of operations. Even though the BitShares Blockchain comes with over 50 already implemented operations which deserve to be presented, this document focuses on the description of the BitShares Blockchain as a platform, its architecture as well as its governance system using the core native token BTS.
