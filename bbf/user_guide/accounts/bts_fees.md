## Fees

#### Fee Division

Every time an account you referred (e.g., *user001*) pays a transaction fee, that fee is divided among several different accounts. The network takes a 20% cut, and the Lifetime Member who referred *user001* gets a 80% cut.

The registrar is the account that paid the transaction fee to register *user001* with the network. The registrar gets to decide how to divide the remaining 0% between themselves and their own Affiliate Referrer program.

*user001's* registrar chose to share 0% of the total fee with the Affiliate Referrer and keep 0% of the total fee for themselves.

#### Fees

| Pending Fees    | Fees paid by *user001* are divided among the network, referrers, and registrars once every maintenance interval (3600 seconds). |
