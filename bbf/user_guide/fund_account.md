 ## Two Options to Fund your Account
 
- **Send (Transfer)**: This is for between BitShares account holders to send funds. On the BitShares Blockchain , people never need to deal with *addresses* or *public keys*. BitShares account holders can use their *account names* for communication. 
- **Deposits**: BitShares account holders can use one of our partners to move over existing funds into your BitShares account.
